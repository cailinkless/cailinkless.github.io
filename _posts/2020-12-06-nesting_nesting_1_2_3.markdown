*Nested Routes vs. Nested Forms vs. Nested Resources: A Quick Simple Cheat Sheet*

I'm writing the basic breakdown reminders of the differences, similarities, and connections between nested routes, forms, and resources that I wish I had a week ago when I started my third project for the Flatiron Software Engineering program. It's easy to get confused by terms when starting out, especially when you're dealing with similar terms for similar/related concepts, and I went halfway through my project thinking I'd fulfilled the requirement for a nested route when in fact what I'd delivered was a nested form.
