*Important differences between front end JS and backend Ruby Objects*


I had learned a little JavaScript before starting my software engineering program, but it had been a struggle. Comparitively, programming in Ruby seemed as natural as breathing to me, and I dreaded the approaching JavaScript section of my coursework. To my surprise, JavaScript had evolved to be a lot more Ruby-like in the time since my initial foray into the language. This time, I felt a flow, and imagined that my hybrid Ruby-backend / JavaScript backend would come together seamlessly.

This was almost true. However, the newfound similarity between each language led me to forget a few important differences between them, especially when it came to "objects."
